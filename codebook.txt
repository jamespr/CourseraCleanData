The data generated by run_analysis.R processes experiment data collected from accelerometers on the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

Each volunteer is represented in the data as a number from 1 to 30 in the "Subject" variable.

Each activity performed by the subject is contained in the "Activity" variable.

The following signals are represented as variables, as Standard Deviations (std) or Means (mean) for the subject by each activity ('-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.):

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
