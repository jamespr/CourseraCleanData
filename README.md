# Coursera Clean Data
R script to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

## How it works
* The script first reads the necessary tables out of the source zip getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip:

```
activity_labels.txt - provides activity names for activity numbers
features.txt - provides full table variable names
train/.txt and test/.txt - provides main data
```

* It then merges the train and test data into one table and sets the column names from features.tx.

* After this it subsets the data to take only the Standard Deviation and Mean variables (using regex), then the column names are sanitized to remove problematic characters.

* Activity names and Subjects are added for each row in the table, after this a new tidy data table is generated by mean aggregating all variables for each subject by activity.

* This tidy dataset is then written to a file.
